# T41-EP_SDT
This repository is for my version of the T41-EP Sodtware Defined Transceiver designed by Al Peter, AC8GY and Jack Purdum, W8TEE.
There is a companion book available on Amazon that I highly recommend reading before tackling this project.  Even if you don't intend
on building the transceiver but want to learn more about SDRs, the book is a great way to go.

There is also a groups.io forum with tons of good discussion as well as the software for the T41.
